 Hi, I'm Rishab and I am currently working as a Data Scientist/Computer Vision Engineer. Previously, I was a Research Assistant at MARMoT Laboratory, NUS, and the MOON Laboratory, IISER Bhopal. I completed my Bachelor's (B.Tech) from the National Institute of Technology Tiruchirapalli (NIT-Trichy), India, where I was a part of the official robotics club. My interests lie in the intersection of Deep and Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, SLAM, and Robotics. When I'm not working or following my academic passion, I play computer games like Assasin's Creed, COD or DOTA 2.
